Summary
-------

A user who already exists in the system, should be able to login to the system and create new atms. He should also be 
able to manage, edit his own created atms.

Explanation
-----------

1. Database already contains known users (moderators). 
This decision is to allow us to ignore the user registration part, and focus more on content addition portion. We can 
look into user addition / roles etc in later part of our application.
2. Most of the layout decisions have been borrowed from StackOverflow.com. Check out the attached images.
